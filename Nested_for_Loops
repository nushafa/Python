## Nested for Loops

When we have a loop inside a loop, it is known as a nested loop

We can use Nested for loops as well.

The inner loop is executed every time for each iteration of the outer loop

Example:

1 adj = ["red", "healthy", "tasty"]
2 fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
3
4 for x in adj:
5     for y in fruits:
6         print(x, y)
## Output

red apple
red banana
red cherry
healthy apple
healthy banana
healthy cherry
tasty apple
tasty banana
tasty cherry
